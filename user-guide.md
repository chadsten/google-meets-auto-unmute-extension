## üîß Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Working
**Check these first:**
1. ‚úÖ Extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
2. ‚úÖ You're on a Google Meet page (`meet.google.com`)
3. ‚úÖ The meeting has 6+ participants (for auto-mute to occur)
4. ‚úÖ Browser is up to date

### Auto-Unmute Not Triggering
**Possible solutions:**
1. **Increase action delay** to 800-1000ms for slower connections
2. **Refresh the Meet page** and rejoin the call
3. **Check browser console** for error messages (F12 ‚Üí Console)
4. **Try a different browser tab** - open Meet in a new tab

### Settings Not Saving
**Steps to fix:**
1. **Close and reopen** the extension popup
2. **Refresh the browser** completely
3. **Check Chrome storage** isn't full or corrupted
4. **Reinstall the extension** if issues persist

### Button Click Not Working
**Troubleshooting steps:**
1. **Increase action delay** - Google Meet's UI might need more time to load
2. **Check for Meet updates** - Google occasionally changes their interface
3. **Disable other extensions** temporarily to check for conflicts
4. **Try in incognito mode** to rule out browser-specific issues
