## Detailed Description

**Stop Missing Your Chance to Speak!**

Tired of being automatically muted in Google Meet calls with 6+ participants? This extension solves that frustrating problem by automatically unmuting you whenever Google Meet mutes you due to the number of participants.

## 🎯 **The Problem This Solves**

When you join a Google Meet call with more than 6 participants, Google automatically mutes you and shows the message "You are muted due to the number of participants." This can be incredibly frustrating when you need to:
- Jump into important discussions quickly
- Ask urgent questions during presentations
- Participate naturally in team meetings
- Avoid the awkward "you're muted" moments
